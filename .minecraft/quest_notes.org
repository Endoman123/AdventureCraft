* Mod Questlines
Mainly for the purpose of _getting started_ in a mod, and guiding you through the parts of a mod

Rewards should err on the side of less, as basic progressions shouldn't warrant much

* Misc Challenges
Any sort of wierd stuff, mostly for goal setting

Rewards should be either wierd or kinda useful in a "nice to have fashion"
