#+TITLE: Starting Book Outline

* Welcome To Adventure Craft

Welcome to Adventure Craft, a kitchen sink adventure pack. This book includes some information to get you started.

* Your First Tree

Since *No Tree Punching* is installed, getting your first piece wood and making your first tools is less straightforward. The steps can be summarized:
1. Get flint
   You can get flint from gravel, either by breaking or crafting
2. First flint shards
   Taking your piece of *flint* right click on a stone block to knap it into *flint shards*
3. Get a stick
   To acquire sticks without tools, break *tree leaves* to get some *sticks*
4. Make a knife
   Assemble your stick and flint shard to craft a *flint knife*
5. Get plant fiber
   Break grass using the knife to acquire plant fiber
6. Flint Shards Again
   Using the plant fiber, flint shards, and stick, craft a primitive hatchet
7. Primitive Hatchet
   Chop down your first tree!
8. Actual Tools
   Now with your newly acquired wood, start to make real tools by using *Tinker's Construct* (Or make other primitive tools using similar methods).
   You want to craft a *Tool Station*, *Patterns*, and a *Stencil Table* to make more tools
   To make armor you'll need to craft a *Armor Station* and *Armor Forge*
9. Better Tools
   You'll eventually want to upgrade to metallic tools, which will need a smeltery. Alternatively, you could use some modded tools, or loot a dungeon for something.

* Your Changing Body and You

Most of what you do is the same, but you have some additional quality of life improvements.

Press "R" to open a *radial menu* where you can setup key shortcuts.

You can pick up chests, furnaces, machines, etc. with your bare hands using [TODO fill this in]

Head to *Options* and *Controls* to set up keybinds for useful shortcuts

* The World and You

There are many mods included in the pack ranging from tech to magic to nothing in particular. Here is but a few of your options:
